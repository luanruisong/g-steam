## :rocket:Installation

`
  go get -u github.com/luanruisong/g-steam
`

## :bell:Premise

   Before using, you must go to [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/revokekey) to apply for your key.
   
## :anchor:Usage

### Basic usage

```go
    //Create client
    client := steam.NewClient("appkey")
    //Get the render address of steam
    //path -> steam openid Login authentication address
    //callbackPath -> steam browser url to redirect to after successful authentication
    path := client.RenderTo(callbackPath)
    
    //Create receiving return object
    res, err := client.OpenidBindQuery(request.URL.Query())
    fmt.Println(res, err)
    fmt.Println(res.GetSteamId()) //Get steamid

    //Create api object
    api := client.Api()
    //raw return
    raw, err := api.Server("ISteamUser").//Set up service interface
        Method("GetPlayerSummaries").//Set access function
        Version("v0002").//Set version
        AddParam("steamids", "76561198421538055").//Setting parameters (If the key parameter is not set, the client's appKey will be added by default)
        Get(nil) //Initiate a request, and support the incoming structure pointer to receive parameters
    fmt.Println(raw, err) 

```

### Package API

In addition to providing basic encapsulation, we also encapsulate common APIs to make it more convenient to use.

```go
    //Use client to create related server
    appService := isteam_app.New(client)
    iplyerSercer := iplayer_service.New(client)
    economyService := isteam_economy.New(client)
    newsService := isteam_news.New(client)
    remoteStorageService := isteam_remote_storage.New(client)
    userService := isteam_user.New(client)
    userStatsService := isteam_user_stats.New(client)
    util := isteam_webapi_util.New(client)
    //Call the server wrapper function
```
